How do you authenticate to the StackOne API?,"To authenticate to the StackOne API using the Connect Session, you can make a POST request to the endpoint `/connect_sessions/authenticate`. The request must include a JSON payload in the body with the necessary parameters to authenticate the session. Ensure that the request is made over a secure connection and includes any required security credentials, such as basic authentication if needed.

Upon a successful request, you will receive a `201` status code, indicating the details of the authenticated connect session. Handle any potential errors such as `400` for invalid requests, `403` for forbidden access, `429` for too many requests, `500` for server errors, and `501` if the functionality is not implemented.","{""/connect_sessions/authenticate"": {""post"": {""operationId"": ""stackone_authenticate_connect_session"", ""x-speakeasy-name-override"": ""authenticate_connect_session"", ""summary"": ""Authenticate Connect Session"", ""parameters"": [], ""requestBody"": {""required"": true, ""description"": ""The parameters to authenticate"", ""content"": {""application/json"": {""schema"": {""$ref"": ""#/components/schemas/ConnectSessionAuthenticate""}}}}, ""responses"": {""201"": {""description"": ""The details of the authenticated connect session."", ""content"": {""application/json"": {""schema"": {""$ref"": ""#/components/schemas/ConnectSession""}}}}, ""400"": {""description"": ""Invalid request.""}, ""403"": {""description"": ""Forbidden.""}, ""429"": {""description"": ""Too many requests.""}, ""500"": {""description"": ""Server error while executing the request.""}, ""501"": {""description"": ""This functionality is not implemented.""}}, ""tags"": [""Connect Sessions""], ""security"": [{""basic"": []}]}}}",-1.17,0.13,0.0
